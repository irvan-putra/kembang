# AI-Powered Issue Processor

This repository automatically processes GitHub issues using AI and creates pull requests with the results.

## How it Works

1. Create a new issue in this repository
2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Process the issue content using AI
   - Create a new branch
   - Apply the AI-generated changes
   - Create a pull request with the changes

## Usage

Simply create a new issue with your prompt or request. The system will automatically process it and create a pull request with the AI-generated response.

Each pull request will be linked to its originating issue for easy reference.

## Technical Details

The automation is handled by GitHub Actions using the following workflow:
- Triggers on new issue creation
- Creates a new branch for changes
- Processes the issue content with AI
- Creates a pull request with the results

The workflow file can be found in `.github/workflows/issue-to-pr.yml`.

## Note

This is a basic implementation. To make it fully functional, you'll need to:

1. Add your AI service integration (e.g., OpenAI API)
2. Configure appropriate secrets for API keys
3. Customize the response processing logic
